Title: Rust by Projects
# Rust by Projects

When I started learning Rust, I was unsure about where to start. I prefer to learn by making practical things, and this website is my attempt to learn Rust by building projects.

So far, I have planned:

## Phase 1

Rust versions of Linux utilities grep, ls and find. The code is done, need to do a write up now


## Phase 1.1

Use the above to build a simple shell


## Phase 2


Later on, will add more projects, maybe ported from my book [Python for Engineers](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/python-for-scientists-and-engineers/)
